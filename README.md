# Model Introduction
## Overview

This repository provides a collection of machine-learning models for flow-regime identification and nonlinear-degree classification in rough fractures.  
The models are built using **mechanism-enhanced machine learning (ME-ML)**, integrating physical mechanisms from **fluid flow theory** and **fracture morphology**.
